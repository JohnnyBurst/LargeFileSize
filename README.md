# LargeFileSize
Search drive for larger file sizes, see what is eating up your space

Open Powershell ISE as an Administrator. Run each line seperately to identiy variables and get data populated. Will not run in regular Powershell. Runs fine in the ISE.

Replacement of the file size to 1GB or larger is an option as well. To do so, replace the "100MB" entry with "1GB", or whatever size limit you would like to impose on the script. Smaller sizes can result in a higher run time to complete data compiling.
